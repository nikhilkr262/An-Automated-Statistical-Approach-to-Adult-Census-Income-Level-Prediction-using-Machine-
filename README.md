# ADULT CENSUS PREDICTION
The prominent inequality of wealth and income is a huge concern, especially in the United States. The likelihood of diminishing poverty is one valid reason to reduce the world's surging level of economic inequality. The principle of universal moral equality ensures sustainable development and improves the economic stability of a nation. Governments in different countries have been trying their best to address this problem and provide an optimal solution. This study aims to show the usage of machine learning and data mining techniques in providing a solution to the income equality problem. The UCI Adult Dataset has been used for this purpose. Classification has been done to predict whether a person's yearly income in the US falls in the income category of either greater than 50K Dollars or less equal to 50K Dollar’s category based on a certain set of attributes. The Random Forest Classifier Model was deployed which clocked the highest accuracy of 89.88%.

In this project, we Built a model whcih predict whether a person’s income is above 50k or below 50k using various features like age, education, and occupation. The dataset used is the Adult census income dataset from Kaggle which contains about 32561 rows and 15 features. We also build a web application using StreamLIT and deploy using Heroku.

Building such predictive models can help us better understand the population of a country as well as the various factors affecting the economy. Governments can understand such factors and improve upon them leading to the growth of the country.
